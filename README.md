# Justification / Explanation

My website is very simple and straightforward with the basic functionality to do what people need to do the most -- tracking tasks. 

The overall aesthetic of the website is simple enough to not overwhelm any of the users which can allow for less distractions. With the website, it is more important for the users to engage in their tasks rather than its overall aesthetic. With this, I have attempted to layout the website in a way that still quite plain but with some creativity. I utilised cards for a lot of aspects in my project and went for rounded edges. I felt that it would make up for the lack of style that is seen throughout the website. I also became quite picky with how the cards should appear on the screen rather than focusing on how I should display the information effectively. 

While I had lost one feature that I intended to include in my final product, it was satisfying to have a local storage that I could reference for the task list and the covey quadrants as they area directly related to each other. There were also functions and code that I had to think about by myself which were the biggest hurdles I had to face as it tested my knowledge, and it also consumed a lot of my time. 

I had mostly implemented the features I wanted to include such as the basic task list, music player, timer, covey quadrants, and the flow time tracker. I could not implement the reading list creator as I spent a lot of time trying to understand the code that I have been referencing in my website. Because of this, there is also the lack of styling as I had allocated most of my time comprehending and experimenting with the code that I come across on various websites. 

I was also quite nit picky with how the different elements were placed on the website and spent a lot of time adjusting the display of the content.  

From my first design, I decided to design the website as best as I could. I did not take in consideration the amount of time it would take to create the website I had initially wanted to produce. As I was collecting and researching code from Youtube, Google, and Stack Overflow, I realised that a lot of what I wanted to produce took a lot of time, and I had not managed my time well. One design element that stayed persistent were the cards as I felt that it provided a smooth and clean look despite the lack of styling. 

In terms of features, they had mostly stayed the same except for the flow time tracker. I found that I had not found a good resource to implement an automatic stopwatch that saves the break time and opted for a number input instead. The form design (when the users want to input their task details) was only slightly planned with sketches, but it had not been fully considered until its creation. The initial form creation was across the screen which could have been too much for the user, so the current form design is something I am also quite satisfied with. 

Overall, I am quite satisfied with what I had made despite its bad aesthetic. I would have definitely worked on the display of my website and the reading list creator if I had planned myself better.
